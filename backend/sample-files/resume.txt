### **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

**Stark Industries | San Francisco, CA**
**Principal Systems Engineer, Secret Management** (January 2019 – Present)

*   Owned and automated the entire secret management lifecycle for business-critical assets across a distributed infrastructure spanning AWS, Azure, and GCP, supporting over 200 engineering teams.
*   Engineered a zero-downtime, automated cryptographic key rotation system for a fleet of 50,000+ containerized services, which eliminated service degradation and reduced manual intervention by 98%.
*   Acted as the lead incident commander for all P0/P1 service outages related to cryptographic services and certificate expirations. Successfully led the response to a critical identity loss scenario affecting a primary authentication service, restoring full functionality 30% faster than the established SLO.
*   Designed and implemented a custom certificate lifecycle management solution that proactively identified and renewed over 10,000 internal and external TLS certificates annually, preventing any potential outages from expiration.

**Cyberdyne Systems | Austin, TX**
**Senior Cloud Security Engineer** (June 2016 – January 2019)

*   Managed and secured multi-cloud environments for enterprise clients, with a heavy focus on AWS and GCP.
*   Developed robust automation scripts in Python to enforce security policies and manage IAM roles, reducing configuration drift by over 70%.
*   Played a pivotal role in the incident response team, contributing to the rapid mitigation and detailed analysis of several critical security events, including data spillage and unauthorized access attempts.
